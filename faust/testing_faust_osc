-- first, don't forget to build the program with the osc option:

[bananapi@lemaker faust]$ ./faust2alsaconsole -osc fosc24.1.dsp

-- start a screen or tmux and execute this:

> oscdump 5511


-- start another session and execute the faust program. for example:

> ./fosc24.1 --device hw:1

-- hopefully will get a messsage from oscdump like this;

Faust OSC version ssssiii "0.94" "-" "'0x00'" "is running on UDP ports " 5510 5511 5512


-- now try these messages:

> oscsend localhost 5510 "/*" s hello
> oscsend localhost 5510 "/*" s get

-- if you get nothing, then osc isn't working.  try restarting without anything running, there seems
-- to be a bug where it won't receive osc message if its started when there's a lot of cpu activiy
