install faust from source!, at least that's what worked for me.

on raspbian, I installed faust from packages (apt-get install faust) first.  That doesn't come with the faust2alsaconsole script though, which is what I use to compile.  so I removed the faust package, but I think it left its library dependencies in place.  

At any rate, at this point installing from source was pretty straightforward 
  git clone https://github.com/nlogax/faust.git
  cd faust
  make
  sudo make install

then 
  cd cyclophone/faust
  ./faust2alsaconsole -osc osc24.dsp
  ./startosc24_pi.sh

But it got a misssing runtime library error.  So, "sudo apt-get install asoundlib2-dev"

Also, faust2alsaconsole needs this line:

elif [[ $(uname -m) == armv7l ]]; then
  MYGCCFLAGS="-O3 -march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard -ffast-math -ftree-vectorize"

in its MYGCCFLAGS section.
