install faust from source!

on raspbian, I installed faust from packages first.  that doens't come with the faust2alsaconsole script though, which is what I use to compile.  so I removed that, but I think it left its library dependencies in place.  

At any rate, installing was pretty straightforward 
  make
  sudo make install

After that I needed to install package asoundlib2-dev.

Also, faust2alsaconsole needs this line:

elif [[ $(uname -m) == armv7l ]]; then
  MYGCCFLAGS="-O3 -march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard -ffast-math -ftree-vectorize"

in its MYGCCFLAGS section.
