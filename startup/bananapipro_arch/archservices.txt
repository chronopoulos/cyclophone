Because apparently rc.local is no longer a thing, we need to have systemd services to kick off 
cyclophone and etc.  

install example: 

sudo cp spimod.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp spimod.sh /usr/bin
sudo systemctl enable spimod 

sudo cp cyclophone.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable cyclophone


make sure files are executable and etc!
